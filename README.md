any To-Do item. Upon creating a To-Do item you will see 2 buttons on the side of the each item that you create, the 
first button will enable you to edit the item, while the other button will enable you to delete the item. Once you're
finished creating your To-Do item or items you can click the "Log out" button. After which you will see the To-Do item or items
that you created on the User Interface. If you want to edit your To-Do item or items you would have to log back into the 
main part of the application again using your Google Mail.
